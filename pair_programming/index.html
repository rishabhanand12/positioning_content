                Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organised. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding.
                (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elemets.

            <div class="box1">
                You can see that, even thought the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually renderewd on the page. This may not be a hge deal in the first few examples, but

                What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%, right?
            </div>
            <div class="box2">
                Wrong? Because, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.

                <div class="box2">
                    The two elements are side by side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which, in this case, is the same width of the viewport.)
